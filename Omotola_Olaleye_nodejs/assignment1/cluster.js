// The cluster module provides a way of creating child processes that runs simultaneously and share the same server port.
// Node.js runs single threaded programming, which is very memory efficient, but to take advantage of computers multi-core systems, the Cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that each runs on their own single thread, to handle the load.
